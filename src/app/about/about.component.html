    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Scott Straughan, and I’m a 37-year-old full stack software engineer with over 15 years of industry
      experience. I’ve spent the majority of my career at Codeplay Software, where I’ve had the opportunity to grow
      alongside a talented team and work across a broad range of projects and technologies. My core programming
      languages include Python, TypeScript, and Java, and I enjoy the flexibility and problem-solving challenges that
      come with working across the full stack.</p>

    <p>Much of my recent work has involved cloud-based solutions, particularly using AWS services like Lambda, S3, and
      DynamoDB. I take pride in being someone who can be handed a task and see it through to completion—efficiently,
      reliably, and with minimal fuss. I’m known by my colleagues as a friendly and collaborative team member, someone
      who contributes not only technical skills but also a positive and grounded energy to every project I’m involved
      in.</p>

    <p>Outside of work, I enjoy getting outdoors and staying active. You’ll often find me hill walking, keeping up a
      regular routine at the gym, or indulging in my passion for cars. Whether I’m solving a problem in code or taking
      on a new trail, I’m always looking for ways to push forward, keep learning, and enjoy the journey.</p>

    <p>During university and early in my career, I began exploring Android development as part of my personal interest
      in building useful, user-focused tools. One of my first personal projects was an app called SMS2PC—one of the
      earliest Android apps that allowed users to send and receive text messages from their computer via their phone. It
      included both a desktop client and a mobile app, and was well received, earning hundreds of 5-star reviews. Over
      the years, I’ve continued to pursue personal and open source projects, including Saorsail, ScoreDash, jekyll-csp,
      and others. I’m passionate about the value of free and open source software, and I enjoy contributing tools that
      others can build on, learn from, or benefit from directly.</p>
